Once they have absorbed enough ambient energy from the Glade, they mature into the ever-inquisitive sprout. Sprouts have a tendency to explore, but don’t grow into goliaths until they have taken in even more of the natural magic that infuses the Glade. The final form of the feycap, the goliath is a huge lumbering creature with fearsome might and mastery over teleportation magic.</p>\n<p>At every stage of their lives, feycaps have a propensity for playing pranks on all manners of creatures. While this is most pronounced in sprouts, even runts and goliaths enjoy moving objects, creatures, and even structures to unexpected places. This sense of humor is not always appreciated and relatively ‘harmless’ pranks escalate against those that don’t demonstrate the proper respect for their comedic genius.

Fire fascinates and entices them and adventurers have reported one approaching their fire and simply watching it for the night, feeding it whenever it got low. Some have even kept them as traveling companions responsible for all maintaining campfires, handling torches, and other fire-related tasks.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, they are not always so benign. There have been numerous cases where a simple campfire isn’t enough for a boomshroom and it seeks to make it grow. Some have also been known to grow violent when the fires they start are doused and others are unrepentant arsonists who light fire regardless of the danger they pose. When their ire is roused, they typically begin combat by spreading their spores, either from afar or around them, and then try to detonate them. Boomsrooms have little fear of death and some almost seem to make it a contest to have the most spectacular death.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Surprisingly affable creatures, boomshrooms often congregate together or alongside creatures with similar values. On the material plane, it isn’t odd to find boomshrooms living among goblin tribes, fire giants, and occasionally even the caves of fire-breathing dragons. Occasionally, boomshrooms can be found on the Elemental Plane of Fire where they toddle after fire elementals that they practically worship.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["fire","fungus"],"senses":{"value":"low-light vision"},"languages":{"value":["ignan","sylvan"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"sm"}},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":null,"lastMigration":null},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":2},"dex":{"mod":1},"con":{"mod":4},"int":{"mod":0},"wis":{"mod":-1},"cha":{"mod":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":11,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":8,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":6,"saveDetail":""}}},"items":[{"name":"Athletics","type":"lore","system":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.815,"lastMigration":null},"mod":{"value":9},"proficient":{"value":0}},"_id":"FuXL5BAJYdSwMKb9","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"V0rBF4YrUAXdg0sJ":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.6.7","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1674078877331,"modifiedTime":1674078887735,"lastModifiedBy":"V0rBF4YrUAXdg0sJ"}},{"name":"Nature","type":"lore","system":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.815,"lastMigration":null},"mod":{"value":7},"proficient":{"value":0}},"_id":"JMccKl1HyKv3mbWM","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"V0rBF4YrUAXdg0sJ":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.6.7","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1674078882962,"modifiedTime":1674078887735,"lastModifiedBy":"V0rBF4YrUAXdg0sJ"}},{"type":"action","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Death Throes","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>When a boomshroom dies, its body explodes in a @Template[type:emanation | distance:20] of flame.

While their grander motivations seem unclear, breath takers are often found to be fickle and tempestuous, just as their progenitor. A breath taker may choose to leave its victim merely light-headed and out of breath or to ruthlessly murder it at a whim and accounts on why this is the case vary widely. Breath takers are capable of speech, but those that are able to communicate with them report that they don’t say much beyond seductions and whispers of desire.</p>\n<p>While breath takers will occasionally form into groups that will descend upon large groups of mortals, like at parties and banquets, they rarely interact with each other.

Infused with essence from the Plane of Fire, boomshrooms are guileless pyromaniacs who spread fire without any ill intent. Fire fascinates and entices them and adventurers have reported one approaching their fire and simply watching it for the night, feeding it whenever it got low. Some have even kept them as traveling companions responsible for all maintaining campfires, handling torches, and other fire-related tasks.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, they are not always so benign. There have been numerous cases where a simple campfire isn’t enough for a boomshroom and it seeks to make it grow. Some have also been known to grow violent when the fires they start are doused and others are unrepentant arsonists who light fire regardless of the danger they pose. When their ire is roused, they typically begin combat by spreading their spores, either from afar or around them, and then try to detonate them. Boomsrooms have little fear of death and some almost seem to make it a contest to have the most spectacular death.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Surprisingly affable creatures, boomshrooms often congregate together or alongside creatures with similar values. On the material plane, it isn’t odd to find boomshrooms living among goblin tribes, fire giants, and occasionally even the caves of fire-breathing dragons.

While their grander motivations seem unclear, breath takers are often found to be fickle and tempestuous, just as their progenitor. A breath taker may choose to leave its victim merely light-headed and out of breath or to ruthlessly murder it at a whim and accounts on why this is the case vary widely. Breath takers are capable of speech, but those that are able to communicate with them report that they don’t say much beyond seductions and whispers of desire.</p>\n<p>While breath takers will occasionally form into groups that will descend upon large groups of mortals, like at parties and banquets, they rarely interact with each other. In general, they remain largely disinterested in creatures other than their prey, which consists mostly of humanoids. Some breath takers will even develop a preference for certain traits and continually seek out victims possessing those traits – or repeatedly target a single individual that meets their preferences.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While exceedingly rare, a mortal may end up earning the deeper affections of a breath taker. Still given to a capricious nature, such a breath taker will come and go at its leisure and offer aid to its paramour at the same frequency. Such breath takers are playful creatures who enjoy taking part in chases or playing hide-and seek from their partner, but they can turn surprisingly vicious, like a breeze transforming into a storm, when they feel the object of their affection is threatened.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["air","elemental"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"languages":{"value":[],"selected":[],"custom":""},"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"med"}},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":null,"lastMigration":null},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":3},"dex":{"mod":5},"con":{"mod":2},"int":{"mod":2},"wis":{"mod":3},"cha":{"mod":4}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":0,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":0,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":0,"saveDetail":""}}},"items":[{"name":"Acrobatics","type":"lore","system":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.815,"lastMigration":null},"mod":{"value":20},"proficient":{"value":0}},"_id":"xuY3szJAGRT2Bopr","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"V0rBF4YrUAXdg0sJ":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.6.7","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1674082320687,"modifiedTime":1674082338195,"lastModifiedBy":"V0rBF4YrUAXdg0sJ"}},{"name":"Athletics","type":"lore","system":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.815,"lastMigration":null},"mod":{"value":16},"proficient":{"value":0}},"_id":"b1RUNtnaEBNSDs2I","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"V0rBF4YrUAXdg0sJ":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.6.7","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1674082325613,"modifiedTime":1674082338195,"lastModifiedBy":"V0rBF4YrUAXdg0sJ"}},{"name":"Stealth","type":"lore","system":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.815,"lastMigration":null},"mod":{"value":18},"proficient":{"value":0}},"_id":"wX9qoVVQ3s4abVXK","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"V0rBF4YrUAXdg0sJ":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.6.7","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1674082329157,"modifiedTime":1674082338195,"lastModifiedBy":"V0rBF4YrUAXdg0sJ"}},{"type":"action","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Love's in the Air","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.v61oEQaDdcRpaZ9X]{Aura} @Template[type:emanation|distance:25]</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Creatures within the breath taker’s aura must succeed at a @Check[type:will|dc:26] save each round or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix]{Stunned 1} (or @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix]{Stunned 2} on a critical failure).</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["aura"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[{"key":"Aura","radius":25,"slug":"love-in-the-air","colors":{"border":"#d3cefc","fill":"#d3cefc"}}],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.815,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2023-01-18T16:53:07.511-06:00","version":{"schema":null,"foundry":"10.291","system":"4.6.7"}}},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actionCategory":{"value":""},"actions":{"value":null},"requirements":{"value":""},"trigger":{"value":""},"deathNote":false},"_id":"lRPYhE1S5PsJ0YX6","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"V0rBF4YrUAXdg0sJ":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.6.8","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1674082387581,"modifiedTime":1674507099495,"lastModifiedBy":"V0rBF4YrUAXdg0sJ"}},{"type":"action","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Reaction.webp","name":"Shifting Scarves","system":{"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Trigger </strong>The breath taker is targeted by a melee attack made with a weapon</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Wind-whipped scarves and silks flare up towards the attacker and the breath taker @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Dt6B1slsBy8ipJu9]{Disarm} the triggering weapon.

In turn, breath takers appear to be manifestations of that aspect, beauteous figures that appear wrapped in windwhipped silks and scarves who lure mortals too them – and suffocate them with a breath-stealing kiss. While their grander motivations seem unclear, breath takers are often found to be fickle and tempestuous, just as their progenitor. A breath taker may choose to leave its victim merely light-headed and out of breath or to ruthlessly murder it at a whim and accounts on why this is the case vary widely. Breath takers are capable of speech, but those that are able to communicate with them report that they don’t say much beyond seductions and whispers of desire.</p>\n<p>While breath takers will occasionally form into groups that will descend upon large groups of mortals, like at parties and banquets, they rarely interact with each other. In general, they remain largely disinterested in creatures other than their prey, which consists mostly of humanoids. Some breath takers will even develop a preference for certain traits and continually seek out victims possessing those traits – or repeatedly target a single individual that meets their preferences.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While exceedingly rare, a mortal may end up earning the deeper affections of a breath taker. Still given to a capricious nature, such a breath taker will come and go at its leisure and offer aid to its paramour at the same frequency.

In turn, breath takers appear to be manifestations of that aspect, beauteous figures that appear wrapped in windwhipped silks and scarves who lure mortals too them – and suffocate them with a breath-stealing kiss. While their grander motivations seem unclear, breath takers are often found to be fickle and tempestuous, just as their progenitor. A breath taker may choose to leave its victim merely light-headed and out of breath or to ruthlessly murder it at a whim and accounts on why this is the case vary widely. Breath takers are capable of speech, but those that are able to communicate with them report that they don’t say much beyond seductions and whispers of desire.</p>\n<p>While breath takers will occasionally form into groups that will descend upon large groups of mortals, like at parties and banquets, they rarely interact with each other. In general, they remain largely disinterested in creatures other than their prey, which consists mostly of humanoids. Some breath takers will even develop a preference for certain traits and continually seek out victims possessing those traits – or repeatedly target a single individual that meets their preferences.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While exceedingly rare, a mortal may end up earning the deeper affections of a breath taker. Still given to a capricious nature, such a breath taker will come and go at its leisure and offer aid to its paramour at the same frequency.

In turn, breath takers appear to be manifestations of that aspect, beauteous figures that appear wrapped in windwhipped silks and scarves who lure mortals too them – and suffocate them with a breath-stealing kiss. While their grander motivations seem unclear, breath takers are often found to be fickle and tempestuous, just as their progenitor. A breath taker may choose to leave its victim merely light-headed and out of breath or to ruthlessly murder it at a whim and accounts on why this is the case vary widely. Breath takers are capable of speech, but those that are able to communicate with them report that they don’t say much beyond seductions and whispers of desire.</p>\n<p>While breath takers will occasionally form into groups that will descend upon large groups of mortals, like at parties and banquets, they rarely interact with each other. In general, they remain largely disinterested in creatures other than their prey, which consists mostly of humanoids. Some breath takers will even develop a preference for certain traits and continually seek out victims possessing those traits – or repeatedly target a single individual that meets their preferences.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While exceedingly rare, a mortal may end up earning the deeper affections of a breath taker. Still given to a capricious nature, such a breath taker will come and go at its leisure and offer aid to its paramour at the same frequency.

In turn, breath takers appear to be manifestations of that aspect, beauteous figures that appear wrapped in windwhipped silks and scarves who lure mortals too them – and suffocate them with a breath-stealing kiss. While their grander motivations seem unclear, breath takers are often found to be fickle and tempestuous, just as their progenitor. A breath taker may choose to leave its victim merely light-headed and out of breath or to ruthlessly murder it at a whim and accounts on why this is the case vary widely. Breath takers are capable of speech, but those that are able to communicate with them report that they don’t say much beyond seductions and whispers of desire.</p>\n<p>While breath takers will occasionally form into groups that will descend upon large groups of mortals, like at parties and banquets, they rarely interact with each other. In general, they remain largely disinterested in creatures other than their prey, which consists mostly of humanoids. Some breath takers will even develop a preference for certain traits and continually seek out victims possessing those traits – or repeatedly target a single individual that meets their preferences.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While exceedingly rare, a mortal may end up earning the deeper affections of a breath taker. Still given to a capricious nature, such a breath taker will come and go at its leisure and offer aid to its paramour at the same frequency.

In turn, breath takers appear to be manifestations of that aspect, beauteous figures that appear wrapped in windwhipped silks and scarves who lure mortals too them – and suffocate them with a breath-stealing kiss. While their grander motivations seem unclear, breath takers are often found to be fickle and tempestuous, just as their progenitor. A breath taker may choose to leave its victim merely light-headed and out of breath or to ruthlessly murder it at a whim and accounts on why this is the case vary widely. Breath takers are capable of speech, but those that are able to communicate with them report that they don’t say much beyond seductions and whispers of desire.</p>\n<p>While breath takers will occasionally form into groups that will descend upon large groups of mortals, like at parties and banquets, they rarely interact with each other. In general, they remain largely disinterested in creatures other than their prey, which consists mostly of humanoids. Some breath takers will even develop a preference for certain traits and continually seek out victims possessing those traits – or repeatedly target a single individual that meets their preferences.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While exceedingly rare, a mortal may end up earning the deeper affections of a breath taker. Still given to a capricious nature, such a breath taker will come and go at its leisure and offer aid to its paramour at the same frequency.
